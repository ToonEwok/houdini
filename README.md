The Houdini is a drop-in mixbox conversion for fight sticks with ~23.5MM holes for said stick (sanwa or hori will work off the top of my head).

### Note:  
As of May 26, 2025 I am yet to get the PCB's printed and tested, if I would've known I was going to make this I would've waited before placing my order with the pcb manufacturer. At any rate this your disclaimer that this has not technically been tested only test fit, however I am 99.9% sure it will work and will be ordering a small batch the next time I place an order for a bigger personal project I currently have.

To assemble you will need:

- 1x PCB  
- ~37 grams of the filament of your choice for the following parts:  
  - 1x houdini_top  
  - 1x houdini_base  
  - 1x houdini_screw  
- 4x choc v1 switches  
- 4x choc v1 hotswaps (PG1350)  
- 6x M2x4MM screws  
- 6x M2 brass inserts, the dimensions of the ones I used are M2x3x3.5  
- Really any wire, 22 AWG is the typical gauge for fight sticks  

Lastly, if you are using this to plug directly into an existing wiring harness I recommend getting a female 2.54 pitch 5 pin connector and some 2.54 male-to-male pins (something like these - https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/harwin-inc/D01-9923246/3918909) that should allow you to plug into your existing harness with no issue.
